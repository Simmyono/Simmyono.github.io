        <h2>Information</h2>
        <p>Hawaii is the 50th state of the USA, made up of eight main islands. It was accepted as a state of the United States on March 18th, 1959. It is located in the pacific ocean. The capital of Hawaii is Honolulu.</p>
        <h2>Places to visit:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Honolulu</strong></li>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Honolulu01_%28cropped%29.JPG" alt="Honolulu City" height="250">
            <p>Because Honolulu is the capital of Hawaii, many tourists visit Honolulu. It is located on the island of Oahu. Eighty percent of the population of Hawaii lives in Honolulu.</p>
            <li><strong>The Arizona Memorial</strong></li>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/USS_Arizona_Memorial_from_the_tour_boat.JPG" alt="Arizona Memorial" height="250">
            <p>This Memorial was made in honor of everyone who died at Pearl Harbor. It has seven windows on each side, and seven on the top, making a total of 21, to sybolize the 21 gun salute.</p>
            <li><strong>Volcanoes</strong></li>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Puu_Oo_cropped.jpg" alt="Hawaii Volcano" height="250">
            <p>There are many volcanoes in Hawaii. There is a volcano named Mauna Kea, and the height of this volcano is about 14,000 above the sea level, but if it is mesured from its base, which is inside the ocean, then its overall height would be around 33,500 feet and that makes it taller than Mount Everest.</p>
            <li><strong>Waimea Canyon State Park</strong></li>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Waimea_Canyon_mar_2010.jpg/250px-Waimea_Canyon_mar_2010.jpg" alt="Waimea Canyon State Park" height="250">
            <p>Waimea Canyon State Park is often refered to as the "Grand Canyon of the Pacific." The canyon is ten miles long, and reaches the depths of 3600 feet.</p>
            <li><strong>Maui Ocean Center</strong></li>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Maui_Ocean_Center.jpg" alt="Maui Ocean Center" height="250">
            <p>The Maui Ocean Center allows tourists to see up close what lies under the surface of the ocean. The 750,000-gallon Open Ocean exhibit gives visitors the chance to walk though an underwater tunnel, surrounded by ocean life including sharks, stingrays, and other marine animals.</p>
